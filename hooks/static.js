/*
  Hooks allow you to alter the behaviour of hoodie-server,
  Hoodieâ€™s core backend module.

  This is possible:
  - get a notification when something in hoodie-server happens
  - extend core features of hoodie-server from a plugin

  A hook is defined as a function that takes a number of arguments
  and possibly a return value. Each hook has its own conventions,
  based on where in hoodie-server it hooks into.

  There are fundamentally two types of hooks:
  - static hooks (this file)
  - dynamic hooks (see dynamic.js)

  The core difference is that static hooks work standalone and just
  receive a number of arguments and maybe return a value. Dynamic
  hooks get initialised with a live instance of the hoodie object,
  that is also available in worker.js, with access to the database,
  and other convenience libraries.

    description: The webserver that powers Hoodie is pwoered by
      the hapi framework (http://hapijs.com). It has the concept
      of a `pack` that defines a set of web server internals.
      Hoodie creates a pack with all the internal things it needs.
      With server.pack.* hooks, you can extend the Hoodie pack.
      See the individual hooks for details on what you can do
      with them.
